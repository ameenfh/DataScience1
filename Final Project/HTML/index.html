    <p>
        It is cheaper, on average, to purchase fruits and vegetables in the US in 2023 than to purchase snack foods. The histograms of the fruits and vegetable data are more right skewed than the snack data. This means that relatively more fruits and vegetables are concentrated around cheaper prices than snacks. In 2023, fruits and vegetables cost an average of $2.27 per pound. In 2023, snacks cost an average of $4.06. This means that snacks cost $1.21 more than fruits and vegetables on average. This trend is the same with the median: $1.9 per pound of fruits/vegetables versus $3.75 per pound of snacks. The fruit and vegetable prices vary from $0.2 to $4.75. On the other hand, snacks range at higher costs, from $2 per pound to $5.75 per pound. Most of the fruit and vegetable costs are between $1.5 and $2.5 while for snacks it is between $3.1 and $4.2.

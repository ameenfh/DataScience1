  <p>In hip hop, so much can be explained by the rise and fall of record labels.</p>

  <p>Lil Waine's ascent is the story of <strong>Cash Money.</strong> The Dirty South starts with <strong>LaFace Records.</strong> The east-coast/west-coast feud is <strong>Bad Boy vs. Death Row.</strong> In hip hop, the artist-label relationship isn't just a business deal, but a commitment to an identity.</p>

  <p>We wanted to surface the notable labels in hip hop's history, so we measured every label by its artists' chart performance on Billboard (collaborating with <a href = "https://twitter.com/KevinBeacham?lang=en">Kevin Beacham</a> of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhymesayers_Entertainment"> Rhymesayers</a> to call out insights). By highlighting the labels who produced the most hits at any given time, we'd understand who was wielding enormous influence on hip hop's sound, distribution, and direction.</p>

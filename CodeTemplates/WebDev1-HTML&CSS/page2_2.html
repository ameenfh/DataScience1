    <p style = "text-align: center"><b> Male vs. Female Decision-Makers and the Bechdel Test</b></p>
    <p style = "text-align: center"> When writing teams are entirely male, about 50% of films fail the Bechdel test. Add a woman to the mix and only a third of films fail. The seven films written entirely by women all pass the Bechdel test. Uncanny, right? That's a small sample: only 200 movies. So let's look at every film (about 4,000 movies) rated on bechdeltest.com. </p>

    <p style = "text-align: center"> Girls, we do not, in fact, run this mother. Men are pervasive in startups, CEOs, engineering, politics - Hollywood is no exception. But in Hollywood, it's plainly visible in the product. When men make films, what's on screen reflects the behind-the-scenes brotopia. </p>
    <p style = "text-align: center"> There are plenty of flaws with the Bechdel Test, but it's a crude way to measure the inclusiveness of a film (and we have 4,00 films rated on the metric). The fact that a filmmaker's gender correlates with the test, wew can stop arguing about the merits of the Bechdel Test and start discussing Hollywood's diversity problem (i.e., 85% of filmmakers are men...nire on this later)</p>

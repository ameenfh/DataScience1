    <h6 style = "color: green; text-align: center"> EXAMINING THE GENDER OF WRITERS, PRODUCERS, AND DIRECTORS WHO MAKE FILMS THAT FAIL THE BECHDEL TEST </h6>
    <p> There's this thing called the Bechdel Test. It measures how male-dominated our beloved Netflix nights really are. To pass, films need to satisfy three requirements: </p>
    
    <div class = "centered-list">
    <ol><b>
        <li> It has at least two women in it </li>
        <li> Who talk to each other, about </li>
        <li> Something besides a man </li>

    </ol></b>
    </div>
    
    <p> It's a low bar, but many good movies don't pass. <em>Birdman</em> fails. <em>Avatar</em> fails. Fucking <em>Toy Story fails</em>. On <a href = "bechdeltest.com">bechdeltest.com</a>, a site for crowdsourcing Bechdel Test results, about <b>40%</b> of films don't pass. It's a sad state since women exist in life, like, half the time. </p>
    <p> Why? Rather than generalize a sexist system, one theory is simple: filmakers, unintentionally, make movies about themselve (i.e., write what you know). Since the most powerful producers, writers, and directors are men, male-themese permeate into Hollywood's output. To see if women are more likely to write about women (i.e, pass the Bechdel test), we compiled the genders of the producers, writers, and directors on thousands of films. </p>

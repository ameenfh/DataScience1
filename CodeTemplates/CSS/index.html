        This is a story about proving, with data, that <i> No Diggity </i> by Blackstreet is timeless.
    </p>

    <p>
        Until recently, it was impossible to measure the popularity of older music. Billboard charts and album sales only tell us about a song's popularity at the time of its release.

So let's examine every song that ever charted, 1990 - 1999, and rank them by number of plays on Spotify, today.
